# Overview

The Memory Matching Game is a fun and interactive web-based game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The goal of the game is to flip over cards and match pairs of identical symbols. This project was developed to improve my understanding of JavaScript syntax, DOM manipulation, event handling, and animations.

Through this project, I explored key JavaScript concepts, including:

ES6 array functions (shuffling and selecting random pairs)
DOM manipulation (dynamically creating elements)
Event-driven programming (handling user interactions)
CSS animations (smooth card flipping)
External JavaScript library (GSAP for animations)
Recursive logic (handling the game state)

I developed this project using the following tools and technologies:

Programming Language: JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
Libraries:
    GSAP for animations
Development Tools:
    Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
    Live Server for local development
